# ShowSearcherApp
Application that synthesizes all shows available on Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime. Users can search for shows by provider, rating, and title. Users can also filter and rate shows. The former Javascript frontend is lost to the winds -- these files use a simple command-line frontend.
